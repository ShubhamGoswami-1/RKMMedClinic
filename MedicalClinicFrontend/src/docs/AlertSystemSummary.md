- ✅ Fixed syntax and TypeScript errors

### useGlobalAlert Hook
- ✅ Created simplified API with type-specific alert methods
- ✅ Added support for all customization options
- ✅ Properly exposed the alert queue for advanced usage

### Demo & Example Components
- ✅ Created AlertExample component for interactive demo
- ✅ Added AlertUsageExample component as implementation reference
- ✅ Fixed duplicate code in AlertExample component

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation (AlertSystemDocumentation.md)
- ✅ Added usage examples and API reference
- ✅ Documented component structure and features

## Modified Files
- `src/components/Alert.tsx`: Core alert component with title support
- `src/context/AlertContext.tsx`: Global alert state management with title support
- `src/hooks/useGlobalAlert.ts`: Simplified API for alerts
- `src/components/AlertExample.tsx`: Interactive demo component
- `src/components/AlertUsageExample.tsx`: Implementation reference
- `src/docs/AlertSystemDocumentation.md`: Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
The alert system is now complete and ready for use throughout the application. Any future enhancements could include:

1. Multiple concurrent alerts support (using the existing queue)
2. Toast-style positioning options (top, bottom, etc.)
3. Additional customization options (e.g., custom icons)
4. Animation variations
5. Accessibility improvements

## Usage
To use alerts in any component:

```tsx
import { useGlobalAlert } from '../hooks/useGlobalAlert';

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { showSuccessAlert } = useGlobalAlert();
  
  const handleOperation = () => {
    // Your logic here
    showSuccessAlert('Operation completed successfully!');
  };
  
  return (
    <button onClick={handleOperation}>
      Complete Operation
    </button>
  );
};
```
